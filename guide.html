<h2 id="object">Object</h2>
<p>The main object of the game is to manipulate the value of blocks so that they match a sequence of numbers, which can be done by placing conveyors on the playing field.
This sequence changes based on which level you are playing.</p>
<h2 id="levels">Levels</h2>
<p>Levels are the main structure of the game.
Each level consists of a sequence of initial block values, and a sequence of expected block values.
Blocks can be checked against the expected block values using the return-conveyor.
If the value matches the sequence of numbers the level requires, the block is accepted and a new block will appear in the top left corner.
If the sequence has been successfully completed, the level has been beat and you can move on to the next one.
If the block does not match the sequence of numbers, the level has been failed and you will have to rearrange your conveyors and try again.</p>
<h2 id="blocks">Blocks</h2>
<p>Blocks are created in the upper left corner when a simulation is started.
They have a value and a position, which can be manipulated by conveyors.
The initial value can be different for each level.</p>
<h2 id="conveyors">Conveyors</h2>
<p>Conveyors are used to manipulate blocks&#39; value and position.</p>
<h3 id="basic-conveyors">Basic Conveyors</h3>
<h4 id="mover">Mover</h4>
<p>The mover-conveyor moves a block one square per tick. This is the most basic conveyor. All other conveyors, except the returning-conveyor, also move the block.</p>
<h4 id="adder">Adder</h4>
<p>The adder-conveyor increments the value of a block by one.</p>
<h4 id="subtractor">Subtractor</h4>
<p>The subtractor-conveyor decrements the value of a block by one.</p>
<h4 id="returner">Returner</h4>
<p>The returner-conveyor checks the value of a block against the number sequence of the current level.</p>
